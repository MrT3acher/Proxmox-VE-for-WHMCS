# Proxmox VE for WHMCS (Module) Provision & Manage

**Salvation, a free and open-source solution for beloved PVE!** If you love it, REVIEW & SHARE IT! ‚ù§Ô∏è

    TNC Dev are looking for a co-developer to assist with finishing the project overhaul.
    If you have proven and public git-logged experience, or similar, please say g'day.
    
    Please note: We are only looking for high-quality applicants with spare time.
    As it stands, we won't have much spare dev time for PVEWHMCS in early 2025.

- Configure VM/CT plans with custom CPU/RAM/VLAN/On-boot/Bandwidth/etc
- Automatically Provision VMs & CTs in **Proxmox VE** from **WHMCS** easily
- Allow clients to view/manage VMs using the WHMCS Client Area
- Create/Suspend/Unsuspend/Terminate via WHMCS Admin Area
- Statistics/Graphing is available in the Client Area for services :)
- Leverage the power of QEMU & LXC with PVE's convenience

## ‚ù§Ô∏è RTFM: Read the Manual & Review the Module!

**Please read the entire README.md file before getting started with Proxmox VE for WHMCS.** Thanks!

We're pretty much done overhauling the Module to suit our needs at The Network Crew Pty Ltd & Merlot Digital.

> **Please review the module!** https://marketplace.whmcs.com/product/6935-proxmox-ve-for-whmcs#reviews
> 
> _If you want it to remain free and fabulous, it could use a moment of your time in reviewing it._ **Thanks!**

## üéØ MODULE: System Requirements (PVE/WHMCS)

### WHMCS must have >100 services!

New Biz: Fresh Installations/Businesses using WHMCS need to take note of the Service ID <100 case.

**SID >100:** The WHMCS Service ID requirement is CRITICAL, as **Proxmox reserves VMIDs <100 (system).** 

_If you don't have enough services (of any status) in WHMCS (DB: tblhosting.id), create enough dummy/test entries to reach Service ID 101+._ **Else you're likely to see an error which explains this:** 

`HTTP/1.1 400 Parameter verification failed. (invalid format - value does not look like a valid VM ID)`

To check, browse to your **latest** service in WHMCS, then check the URL - it will reveal the Service ID. If it is less than 100, subtract it from 100 to deduce how many "dummy services" you need to add in a dummy order. 

Once over 100, it fits the requirement & you're good!

### General Requirements

- (WHMCS) v8.x.x stable (HTTPS)
- (WHMCS) **Service ID above 100**
- (PHP) v8.x.x (latest stable version)
- (PHP) max_execution_time = 300
- (Proxmox) VE v8.x (current)
- (Proxmox) 2 users (API/VNC)

## ‚úÖ MODULE: Installation & Configuration

**DON'T SKIP ANY PART OF THIS README.md - please don't raise pointless Issues - thank you!**

Firstly, you need to upload, activate and make the WHMCS Module available to Administrators.

Once you've done all of that, in order to get the module working properly, you need to:

0. Proxmox VE > Create an additional VNC-only user, per instructions below
1. WHMCS Admin > Config > Servers > Add your PVE host/s (user: root; IP: PVE's)
2. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret (see below)
3. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add KVM/LXC Plan/s
4. WHMCS Admin > Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Add an IP Pool
5. WHMCS Admin > Config > Products/Services > New Service (create offering)
6. " " > Newly-added Service > Tab 3 > **SAVE** (links Module Plan to WHMCS Service type)

## ü•Ω noVNC: Console Tunnel (Client Area)

After forking the module, we considered how to improve security of Console Tunneling via WHMCS. We decided to implement a routing method which uses a secondary user in Proxmox VE with very restrictive permissions. This is due to be re-built again to further enhance security.

### To offer VNC via WHMCS Client Area

1. Install & configure the module properly
2. Follow the PVE User Requirement info below
3. Public IPv4 for PVE (or proxy to private)
4. PVE and WHMCS on the same Domain Name*
5. Have valid PTR/rDNS for the PVE Address

noVNC has been overhauled. It isn't guaranteed, nor the project at all. :-)

- Note #1 = You must use different Subdomains on the same Domain Name, for the cookie (anti-CSRF).
- Note #2 = If your Domain Name has a 2-part TLD (ie. co.uk) then you will need to fork & amend `novnc_router.php` - ideally we/someone will optimise this to better cater to all formats.

## üë• PVE: User Requirements (API & VNC)

**You must have a root account to use the Module at all.** Configured via WHMCS > Servers.

Additionally, to improve security, for VNC you must also have a Restricted User. Configured in the _Module_.

### Creating the VNC user within PVE

1. Create User Group "VNC" via PVE > ` Datacenter / Permissions / Group`
2. Create new User "vnc" > `Datacenter / Permissions / Users` - Group: "VNC", Realm: pve
3. Create new Role -> `Datacenter / Permissions / Roles` - Name: "VNC", Privileges: VM.Console (only)
4. Permit VNC Access -> `Datacenter / Permissions / Add Group Permissions` - Group: "VNC", Role: "VNC"
5. WHMCS > Modules > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Module Config > VNC Secret = 'vnc' password (PVE) you set

> Do NOT set less restrictive permissions. The above is designed for hypervisor security.
> 
> However, if you wish for proper security, wait for VNC to be further improved.

## ‚öôÔ∏è VM/CT PLANS: Setting everything up

These steps explain the unique requirements per-option.

Custom Fields: Values need to go in Name & Select Options.

> **Unsure?** Consult the zMANUAL-PVE4.pdf _legacy_ manual file.

### VM Option 1: KVM, using PVE Template VM

Firstly, create the Template in PVE. You need its unique PVE ID.

Use that ID in the Custom Field `KVMTemplate`, as in `ID|Name`.

> Note: `Name` is what's displayed in the WHMCS Client Area.

### VM Option 2: KVM, WHMCS Plan + PVE ISO

Firstly, create the Plan in WHMCS Module. Then, WHMCS Config > Services.

> Under the Service, you need to add a Custom Field `ISO` with the full location.

### CT Option: LXC, using PVE Template File

Firstly, store the Template in PVE. You need its storage, folder & File Name.

> Use that prefixed file name in the Custom Field `Template`, as in:<br>
> `local:vztmpl/ubuntu-99.99-standard_amd64.tar.gz|Ubuntu 99`

ie. If using ZFS for Templates, substitute local with volume name.

Then make a 2nd Custom Field `Password` for the CT's root user.

## üåê IPv4/v6: Networking (IP Pools)

Please make sure you create an IP Pool with sufficient scope/size to be able to deploy addresses within it to your guest VMs and CTs. Else it won't be able to create a Service for you.

**Private IPs for PVE Hosts:** Note that VNC may be problematic without work due to the strict requirements introduced in Proxmox v8.0 (strict same-site attribute).

### IPv6: SLAAC default, 2nd vNIC

Per The-Network-Crew/Proxmox-VE-for-WHMCS#33 there's SLAAC/DHCP/off available (2x vNICs) (May 2024).

You can of course add different config via PVE/`pvesh` manually, if you need to specify a prefix.

## üíÖ FEATURES: PVE v8.x bling

There are new features deployed into Proxmox VE upstream in the v8 branch which are exciting and should be added to this module.

### Proxmox v8.0

1. Create, manage and assign resource mappings for PCI and USB devices for use in virtual machines (VMs) via API and web UI. 
2. (DONE) Add virtual machine CPU models based on the x86-64 psABI Micro-Architecture Levels and use the widely supported x86-64-v2-AES as default for new VMs created via the web UI. 

### Proxmox v8.1

1. Secure Boot support.
2. Software Defined Networking (SDN).
3. New flexible notification system (SMTP & Gotify).
4. MAC Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) BC:24:11: prefix!

### Proxmox v8.2

1. Import Wizard for Guests.
2. Unattended PVE Install (answer file).
3. Backup Fleecing (local disk as data block buffer).
4. Firewall Preview (based on nftables).

### Proxmox v8.3

1. Software-defined Networking/Firewall.
2. Better guest importing from OVA/OVF.
3. Webhook target for system alerting.
4. Better change detection for PBS.

### Proxmox v8.4

1. Live migrate with mediated devices.
2. Support for external backup providers.
3. Host dir's, share with guests (virtiofs).
